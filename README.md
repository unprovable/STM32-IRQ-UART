What the f*ck is wrong with me?

This is an example STM32F103C8T6 (AKA 'blue pill') project that should setup a UART that gets triggered over the IRQ to do something.

# IT DOESN'T

So, in the spirit of sharing the rage, here's the code. I don't know why it doesn't work. I would love to know why it doens't work.

Halp.
